# Final Project Summary
My **idea** for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at the number of senators asking for extensions on their disclosures by state.  A **visualization idea** is to show a graph of number of extensions by state. And also to break it down by party (i.e. Republican vs Democratic) and over time.

> Sanders expertly exploited a system that effectively allowed him to delay, delay, delay — all while he chided Clinton receipt of six-figure paydays for delivering closed-door speeches to officials at investment bank Goldman Sachs and other powerful special interests [...] Voters couldn’t definitively know whether Sanders — historically one of the Senate’s least wealthy members — suddenly parlayed his political fame into personal profit. Or, for that matter, whether he sustained financial distress.
